    <h1>What to know about cats!</h1>
    <div class="paws">
        <p>Cats are amazingly clean and they come with different attitudes. You don't know what type of cat they are gonna be until you bring them home. For example, you can have grumpy cats or cuddly cats. You can also have dog-like cats that are more "annoying". Cats are low maintenence and do not get lonely easily, so they are perfect forr if you work in an office.</p>

        <p>If you have a cat: Make sure to give them lots of pets. They also like toy mice </p>

        <p id="tails">I would not recommend giving the cat a real mouse becasue contrary to popular belief cats are not the best mouse catchers, so unless you want droppings everywhere and small bites in all of your food, I would recommend getting a toy mouse for your cat.</p>

        <p> Cats can enjoy a bit of catnip here and there but do not give them too much or else they will get sick.</p>
